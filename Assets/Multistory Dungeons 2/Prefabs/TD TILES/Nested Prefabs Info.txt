Prefabs in this folder (Rooms and Tiles) were "Unpacked", which means they no longer have connections to any contained prefabs.
This was done to save time. Before that, Unity had to update all of these prefabs every time even a little change is made to any
contained prefab (like intensity of a torchlight, for example).

If you want this functionality back, the original rooms and tiles with nested prefabs are still available in a Unity Scene in this folder.
